# Graph Manager and Analysis Tool

This project is a C-based program designed to manage and analyze graphs efficiently. It employs heap-based algorithms for shortest path calculations and maintains a dynamic top-k ranking of graph metrics. Developed with a focus on performance and algorithmic efficiency, the project serves as a practical application of advanced data structures such as heaps.

## Features

- **Shortest Path Calculation:** Implements Dijkstra-like algorithms for computing the shortest paths within a graph.
- **Dynamic Top-k Ranking:** Maintains a top-k list of graph metrics, updated dynamically as new graphs are added.
- **Heap-based Algorithms:** Utilizes both min-heap and max-heap structures for efficient data management and sorting.
- **Custom Input Parsing:** Processes adjacency matrix inputs directly from the user with optimized input handling.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and compile the program using a C compiler:
   ```bash
   gcc -o graph_manager main.c
2. Run the executable and follow the prompts to input graph data and commands.

## Commands
- Add Graph: Adds a new graph to the system and updates the top-k ranking.
- Print Top-k: Displays the current top-k list of graph metrics.

## Requirements
- C Compiler (GCC or compatible)
- Standard C Library
